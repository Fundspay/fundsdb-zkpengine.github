# 🛡️ Fundsroom & FundsDB – ZKP Engine Ecosystem  
🚀 Open Source | 🔐 Zero-Knowledge Proofs | 🔍 Privacy-Preserving AI & Data Security  

## 🌎 Welcome to the Fundsroom & FundsDB Ecosystem  

We are building a next-generation **Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP) Engine** for financial data integrity, privacy-preserving AI training, and secure database operations. This ecosystem consists of:  

### 🏗️ **Core Projects**  
🔹 **zkEngine** – A modular, high-performance ZKP computation engine.  
🔹 **FundsDB** – A privacy-focused financial data store with built-in ZKP-based verification.  


### 🔥 **What You Can Do**  
✅ Build ZKP-enabled **data pipelines** without exposing raw information.  
✅ Enable **GDPR-compliant financial processing** using privacy-preserving proofs.  
✅ Securely **train AI models on private datasets** without copying or sharing data.
